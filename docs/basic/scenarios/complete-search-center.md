# Create a complete search center

Maybe you noticed in SharePoint Online, you can now redirect the top bar search box to a custom SharePoint page, with your own Web Parts. 

That's exactly what the 'Data Visualizer' is meant for! By a complete search center, we mean the following elements:

- A **search box** to search inside the page.
- Some **verticals** to browse data as predefined silos (ex: 'People', 'Documents', etc.).
- One or more **results** Web Parts to display items according to a specific source.
- A **filter** Web Part to narrow/filters results.
