# aequos Modern Data Visualizer solution

The 'Modern Data Visualizer' solution is a set of SharePoint Online modern Web Parts allowing SharePoint super users, webmasters and developers to create highly flexible and personalized data viewing and filtering experiences in minutes.

It is the enhanced product version of the well known ["Pattern & Practices Modern Search"](https://github.com/microsoft-search/pnp-modern-search) open-source solution **that we also created**.

Refer to out website to see [differences]() between the two solutions.

> Don't be wrong: **we still continue to invest time and support for the open-source solution**. If it suits your current requirement, feel free to go with it. We will never push someone to purchase the licensed solution. It is completely up to you.

## What's included?

The solution includes the following Web Parts:

| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **[Data Visualizer](./basic/usage/data-visualizer/index.md)** | Retrieve data from a data source and render them in a specific layout.
| **[Data Filters](./basic/usage/data-filters/index.md)** | Filter and refine data displayed in 'Data Visualizer' Web Parts.
| **[Data Verticals](./basic/usage/data-verticals/index.md)** | Browse data as silos (i.e. tabs) from multiple data sources.
| **[Search box](./basic/usage/search-box/index.md)** | Let users enter free text queries sent to 'Data Visualizer' Web Parts.

**Overview video: let's build a complete search center**

## Supported browsers

Here is the list of supported browsers:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Edge Chromium
- Brave
- Safari

**We don't support Internet Explorer 11**. We think there are plenty of other options for enteprise scenarios in the market. Maybe it's time to move on. For developers, it represents an **huge** ammount of time to make the solution compatible for a very low benefit. Hope you understand, ain't personal ;).

## Extensibility model

By getting this solution, you also benefit from an advanced [extensibility model](./basic/extensibility/index.md) allowing you to customize the solution according to your requirements if default features don't do the job for you. 

**The supported extensions are:**

- [Custom data sources](./basic/extensibility/custom_data_source.md).
- [Custom layouts](./basic/extensibility/custom_layout.md).
- [Custom web components](./basic/extensibility/custom_web_component.md).
- [Custom suggestions providers](./basic/extensibility/custom_suggestions_provider.md).
- [Custom Handlebars customization (helpers, partials, etc.)](./basic/extensibility/handlebars_customizations.md).

With these available customizations options, you can do pretty much anything!
