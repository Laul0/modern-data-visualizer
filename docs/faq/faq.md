# Frequently Asked Questions

_You said the 'Data Visualizer' solution is an upgrade from the open source PnP 'Modern Search solution', so basically, you simply reused the same code but now make people pay for it?_

Absolutely not! We started the code from scratch with a completely new design approach. Of course we reuse pattern from the open source solution but there the majority of the codebase is totally new (and much improved from the free version). You may notice this is now much more than only SharePoint search Web Parts.

_I don't want a subscription based model. Can I just buy a 'standalone' version of the solution?_

Of course! Along the subscription model, we provide a standalone option with a license key. All you need is to setup a tenant property in your Office 365 tenant to get it work. It is slightly more expensive than the subscription based model, but it all depends how long you plan to use this solution.
