# Installation

1. Download the latest SharePoint Framework package (**aequos-modern-data-visualizer.sppkg**) from our public GitHub repository:
2. Add the package to your global app catalog or site collection app catalog. If you don't have an app catalog, follow this [procedure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/use-app-catalog) to create one. You can choose to deploy the solution globally or via app (more info [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/tenant-scoped-deployment)).

    > The solution is deployed in the general Office 365 CDN meaning **we don't host any code on our own**.

3. Get a valid license from our website. Don't forget to register the Office 365 tenant ID where you want to use this solution.

4. Add the Web Parts to a SharePoint and start building!
