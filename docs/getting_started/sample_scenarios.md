# Sample scenarios

Wondering what you can do with this solution? Here are some demo videos of common usage scenarios for the Data Visualizer solution. 

## Build a complete search center

In this demo video, we show you how to create a complete search center in a SharePoint page using the full solution Web Parts set (Search Box, Data Filters, Data Visualizer and Data Verticals). This is a typical scenario when you want to bypass the OOTB SharePoint search page limitations and integrate with your own information architecture.

## Build a people directory using the Microsoft Graph data source

A classic use case in a SharePoint portal. This time, instead using the SharePoint search, we use the Microsoft Graph and the [People API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/people-example#search-people) to lookup relevant people based on search box Web Part input keywords.

## Use static taxonomy filters with the SharePoint search data source

Static filters don't necessarily need to be connected to a Data Visualizer Web Part. They are different from ['Refinement' filters](https://aequos-solutions.github.io/modern-data-visualizer/usage/data-filters/#filter-types-static-filter-versus-refiner-filter) and they just send abitrary filter values to consumer Web Parts ignoring received values from the data source. In this demo, we show you a practical use case and how to use them, for instance retrieve data from the SharePoint search according to a specific taxonomy term in a specific terms set **without any prior results fetched** (meaning filter values will be available at page load for initial filtering).
