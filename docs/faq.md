# Frequently Asked Questions

## PnP Modern Search VS aequos Data Visualizer

> _On the first page, you said the 'Data Visualizer' solution is an upgrade from the open source PnP 'Modern Search solution', so basically, you simply reused the same code but now make people pay for it?_

Absolutely not! We started the code from scratch with a completely new design approach. Of course we reuse pattern from the open source solution but the majority of the codebase is totally new (and much improved from the free version). You will see by yourself and notice this is now much more than only SharePoint search Web Parts.

## Subscriptions VS Standalone licences

> _I don't want a subscription based model. Can I just buy a 'standalone' version and can keep the solution forever?_

Of course! Along the subscription based model, we provide a standalone option with a license key. All you need is to setup a tenant property in your Office 365 tenant to get it work. It is slightly more expensive than the subscription based model, but it all depends how long you plan to use this solution.

## Features

> _Does this solution works with SharePoint 2019?_

Due to technical considerations, unfortunately not for now. However we still have this in mind for a near the future. Definitely possible but requires one more work here.
